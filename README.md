# Aditya Ramakrishnan's Portfolio Website

Hi there! This is my coding portfolio that I built with ReactJS and SCSS. I developed this web application to showcase my skills, lay out my projects, and provide a way to contact me. I'm still optimizing the website for all screens but I will get that sorted out soon!
